# UICaption dataset

We release the UICaption dataset consisting of UI images paired with descriptions of their functionality. This dataset was used to train Lexi, a pre-trained vision and language model for UI language understanding. The dataset and model are presented in "Lexi: Self-Supervised Learning of the UI Language" by Pratyay Banerjee, Shweti Mahajan, Kushal Arora, Chitta Baral, and Oriana Riva.

UICaption is released as a workflow by which you can generate the actual data.

# Generate UICaption dataset

### Crawl images and texts from support websites

Use the compiled list of support and how-to websites provided in `tech_urls.txt` to extract UI images and associated descriptions from the web. Save the output to a folder, e.g., `crawled_uidata`:

```
python crawl_uidata.py --i tech_urls.txt --o crawled_uidata
```
This script will generate three files stored in the specified output folder: `ui_images.p` which contains URLs of the UI images, `ui_alt_texts.csv` which contains alt-text associated with each UI image, `ui_instructions_preceding.csv` and `ui_instructions_succeeding.csv` which contains texts appearing before and after the image occurence in the webpage respectively.

Then download the UI images:
```
python download_images.py -i crawled_uidata/ui_images.p
```

### Generate image-text pairs

Finally, use the crawled UI data to assemble the UICaption dataset:
```
python gen_uicaption_dataset.py -i crawled_uidata -o ui_caption_dataset.json
```

The same UI image may appear in multiple websites, hence the script associates one or multiple alt-text descriptions and instructions with each UI image. The script produces a json file with the following format:

|Name|Description|
|----|-----------|
|image_path| path at which the UI image is stored|
|alt_text_list| one or multiple alt-texts associated with the UI image|
|instruction_list| one or more instructions associated with the UI image|
